# NYC Taxi Trip Data – Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on NYC Taxi trip data to uncover demand patterns, pricing behavior, and operational insights. The analysis focuses on data cleaning, temporal trends, anomaly detection, and zone-based demand analysis.

## 📊 Dataset
- NYC Taxi Trip Records
- Features include trip distance, fare components, passenger count, pickup and dropoff zone IDs, and temporal attributes.

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Data understanding and memory optimization
- Rigorous data cleaning with business justification
- Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
- Time-based demand and fare analysis
- Zone-based pickup and revenue analysis
- Anomaly detection using IQR and logical thresholds
- Business insights and actionable recommendations

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Taxi demand and fares vary significantly across hours of the day
- A small number of zones generate a large share of trips and revenue
- Pricing anomalies exist for short and long-distance trips
- Time-based patterns can guide fleet optimization strategies

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Outcome
This project demonstrates practical data analysis skills, business-oriented thinking, and the ability to derive actionable insights from real-world datasets.
